## TODO
- Change button gradient to a dithered gradient?

Debug menu ideas (bonus points: make it a separate window):
- Disable scissor draw limit
- Rootnode draw in middle (x+50, y+50, w-100, h-100 kinda thing)
- Resize bar draw dropdown setting [dont draw, transparent, normal]
- Middle click on any element to see its properties and edit them
