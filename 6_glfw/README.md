```
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```

```
Done:
- Manual delay for FPS (not needed..)

Todo:
- Draw a colored rectangle
- Draw a shader within a rectangle
- Scissor test
- Draw text (try freetype, or find something for subpixel)
- Draw a texture

- Multiple windows
```

need:
- multiple windows
- no raylib window resize mouse bug
- better text rendering (maybe even scissor replacement by moving the rect size and texcoords manually?)
